13381,i lived there for  years  got tired of the unending taxes  high cost of housing  gas  food  etc   gridlock  homelessness  outrageous laws   regulations  hypersympathy for the  less fortunate  or  undocumented    and the unending wildfires   no leadership 
13382,i love  and  ordered  number   to send neighborhood church of chico where there is a maxed out shelter of people who evacuated from the butte county fire      
13383,i love me some lady gaga     
13384,i love that my job is only taking general donations for the wildfires  cat dog food  water bowls and treats  things that the animals actually need
13385,i mean is it industrial pollution  cars  wildfires  all of the above 
13386,i might be wrong  but when we have hurricanes doesnt fema provide emergency shelter  trailers and such     i dont understand why they havent  provided anything for the people displaced by this wildfire  are they going to have to live in a walmart parking lot forever 
13387,i must get fuel for the car  no choice  as i am leaving early tomorrow on a short business trip  and i do  being at home  but  it s terrible all around  i fear this quantity of wildfires is the   normal  in california 
13388,i normally work a technology beat where i casually write about how nobody will own a car in future   this week i       m in a town where those who didn       t have immediate access to a private vehicle most likely died in a wildfire 
13389,i once drove through a wildfire in mountains along nc tn border  no warning on the road  radio  or phone b c it recently started  smoke filled my car  low visibility outside  wind shifted though and i finally got away safely  wasn       t even a big fire  news from ca is terrifying  
13390,i plan on all of this except the midnight suppers  imma drink outside in the wildfire haze  eat unhealthy food at an unhealthy pace  and neglect the shit out of bowels this evening  i       ll be in bed by    though  because i       m old 
13391,i play brockhampton in the car so much my mom knows all the words to wildfire
13392,i ran into a wildfire to save my suits last year  house was filled with smoke when i got there  dark  no lights  and the neighbors place was on fire  dumped all the furry stuff into the fursuit box  that was the first thing that i took to the car  in the end i got really lucky 
13393,i rarely read his tweets  i  t have to because every news program i watch shows them  he has a nice long plane ride to tweet his  brains  out  plus  he ll be feeling so proud of himself when he single handedly instructs us californians on how to prevent wildfires  
13394,i read an article about a woman who left  and eventually lost  everything behind and carried her enormous pitbull in a duffel bag on her back as she had to ride her bicycle through a fucking wildfire to safety  and then there are people  these   
13395,i really appreciate  doing this  money has been tight and my partner and i have been too sick from the wildfire smoke to cook  when  tagged me in that post i knew i       d actually be able to afford enough food to even have leftovers  thank  
13396,i remember in  when i was in middle school in san diego  we had to shelter in place cause of a wildfire  what made it worse was that even tho classes were cancelled  my parents wouldn       t pick me up cause oak valley told them not to 
13397,i remember sitting at a red light at pepperdine university with a wildfire burning all around me  on both sides of the pch  i was sitting in an evil looking car and it was the most los angeles moment in ten years of living there  good luck  malibu 
13398,i saw it happen a lot in california with the wildfires  i think people use        i       m gonna ride it out        as a cover for the embarrassment they feel that they        t have enough money to evacuate  it       s so sad 
13399,i should be able to make an  claim for passengers who make my car stink of marijuana  been riding around for an hour with my windows open to air out the stench  it       s overpowering the smell of the smoke from the wildfires 
13400,i should have said   most precious handful of books   obviously i m not imagining  filling  car with stacks of paper novels before driving to safety through a wildfire area 
13401,i so want to help the folks affected by the     i m willing to shuttle people free of charge in my private vehicle  i m based at lax  if  are affected by this event             
13402,i support any fledgling football league  going up against the nfl  however  i must say that the name is weak  crossed pulaskis  seriously  why not crossed spatulas  far more people relate to chefs and food preppers than  wildfire fighters  i agree  it s as ridiculous as hotshots 
13403,i sure am the prince     me and my    in my food stamps account       what   republicans made the opposition toward me happen     but i hate a lot of democrats too     so have fun with  wildfires and ears with saudi arabia and all that shit ouch guys     
13404,i sure hope not   can       t the horrible wildfires and hurricanes wake up at least some people  agriculture depends on a moderate  predictable climate  we must have food and water 
13405,i talked to my dad the other day  he lives in minnesota  he skipped a bike ride    he bikes year round  even in the dead of winter    because the air quality was so bad from the smoke from the wildfires in western canada  over   miles away 
13406,i think bill is choking on some kind of smoke  but it isn t from cars or wildfires   
13407,i think for people who are so far away   may not  the geography of the area  seeing  shelter in place  while an out of control wildfire is raging is  kind of nerve wracking     it sounds almost   re trying to wait out a fire   survive  it s a terrible term to use 
13408,i think i       ll take the word of the  scientists   lol not         i       m sure        ve heard something about this by now  but it bears repeating  there could be        worsening food shortages and wildfires  and a mass die off of            
13409,i think it       s the level of danger  i       m not saying hurricane       s aren       t dangerous  but wildfires move very fast  and burn incredibly hot   melt  car down to its axles from ft away hot  probably not the whole reason  but something to consider          
13410,i think most of this smoke is from the barge on fire in  west  so that       s comforting       it       s not because of apocalyptic eternal drought wildfires   a bunch of cars on fire  
13411,i think of sherri jane writing hard across the prairie when i hear this song  ready to ride  a whirlwind  it s rodeo time  wildfire  michael martin murphey   via  for    
13412,i think the chemistry of a wildfire emission might be significantly different than the chemistry of car  truck  and big rig combustion engine exhaust   here is some more information on the chemistry of exhaust          
13413,i think the roundup news means the fatalities in the camp wildfire around   including paradise which rose to  confirmed dead with  still unaccounted for  the woolsey wildfire has  fatalities  both found in a vehicle in malibu  latest acre total for the woolsey wildfire k          
13414,i took a deep look at the  special issue on rewilding and climate change  some really interesting food for thought across the research  including how elephants emit less methane than cattle and how white rhinos could suppress wildfires            
13415,i understand romaine is a food consumed by people who enjoy that kind of stuff but how come there       s more lettuce on my timeline than wildfire or mass shooting coverage    
13416,i understand that the state  as first responders  must help the wildfire victims but these victims need federal assistance  so far trump and hls get an f for federal response in response to michael  maria  harvey  irma  people need adequate shelter  food  clothing  healthcare          
13417,i understand the scenic allure of living in historic  zones  but building codes need to be changed   houses need to be made of fire resistant materials   feature a safe room comparable to a bomb shelter to preserve valuables    where the family can safely ride out fire  
13418,i volunteer all the time and regularly for two food pantries  some volunteers have no concept of what it       s  to be on the other side of the counter  and it       s evident  we       re all one paycheck  one illness  one wildfire  tornado  hurricane  one something away   smh
13419,i wanna see a map  this showing how far the ash from the wildfire has reached  i have ash all over my car          
13420,i was honored to help  last week during the most devastating wildfire california has ever seen  so glad to hear that mack  a rescued cat at yuba city rescue shelter  is going home to a loving family   
13421,i was referring to  being a possible tree hugger  nothing to do with any wildfires  now let the rest of us enjoy liking a big engined car and  carry on riding  bicycle 
13422,i was sure i would see wildfire broken down  but instead on hwy     i would see a chupacabra run right in front of the car  we stopped at burger king  ate onion rings   discussed what we saw  that was the last time i worked w tommy rich  
13423,i wasn       t happy    they made me ride in the back seat with that bug eyed schulte   the called him wildfire cause of the rampant std       s he had 
13424,i went for a ride in the forest today  in florida  i could have taken a blowtorch with me   would not have been able to start a wildfire despite all of the underbrush  leaves  pine cones  needles    other natural detritus  i did  however  see a doe raking with two of her fawns 
13425,i went up to moms today   min car ride and triggered a migraine  i am so tired of wildfire season    went out less than  mins to move the car  nauseous  bleh   hugs  take it easy  
13426,i will believe that this car was part of the wildfire damage when i see proof of where and when the picture was taken  the more i look at it the more it looks  arson 
13427,i will have more details on this story on monday  but for now we  walmart has avoided a lengthy trial on charges it sold wildfire contaminated food in fort mcmurray          
13428,i wish i could do more   would take a pack of dogs  too far away so i ve donated to a shelter and ca wildfire fund 
13429,i worry about this too    i often feel guilty for bringing a child into the world because of future practical concerns  such as safe shelter  food supplies  clean water   air     i would ride wildfire for them  and that s serious business       i wrote this poem last year
13430,i  love  this   she brings her light to those in time of darkness     showed up at a red cross  evacuation shelter bearing pizza and spending time with those who have had to flee the            
13431,i ll be on  at am to discuss  kevin mccarthy s claim california s wildfires  are producing more emissions than all of our cars   look for our fact check this afternoon at  
13432,i m a couple of hours away in palm desert   and more than willing to fight traffic  wildfires earthquakes driverless cars and  rabid trump supporters to be there  
13433,i m a proud northern california deplorable   would      shut  up  we  the problem    timing sucks  thanks for caring enough to come out here to comfort us   hand out some food where  numbers were huge  oh  wait     t go to wildfire disasters  do   
13434,i m already shut inside during wildfire season using my nebulizer x a day  to survive  when i go out on a clear day my daughter has to pull over if a truck gets too close  idling cars make me sick  now i have to deal with more pollution  great         
13435,i m also a former ff from ca  i participated in many wildfires  what impressed me was the amount of fuel that burned  there was an incredible amt of underground underbrush   can tell by so much of treetops uneffected but cars melted  that was mismanagement  this is on brown 
13436,i m also convinced that the omnipresent scent of smoke has inflamed an ancient  wolfish wildfire avoidance response deep inside them  in short  they have gone completely off the deep end  i fear that no amount of food  bones or chew toys can bring them back  only fresh air   twitter  xkgbgbewg
13437,i m confused by pepperdine u  shelter in place  decision instead of evacuating  can one effectively safely shelter from a significant wildfire 
13438,i m curious if some kind of fire shelter could be built in areas more susceptible to wildfire   a tornado shelter in the midwest
13439,i m driving   sent from my car   found dead in vehicles caught up in a wildfire in paradise  northern california  thousands were forc   
13440,i m getting used to seeing a layer of ash on my car each morning   and i m in ab  we ve  only seen a red sun this week  the smoke is as far as sask   british columbia declares state of emergency as over  wildfires burn         
13441,i m going to make a donation to tears  who always do amazing work   help loads of pets where owners can t pay    they helped animals during the wildfires before so    really worth supporting the work they do    but i can t physically deliver dog food  who in ct is up for this          
13442,i m in west la  i can take in a few small animals and take care of them for    including food  please message me and be safe     
13443,i m  trying to get my head around the fact that so many people have perished  or had to take shelter in a lake while fire burned all around them  how did it get to that point  what can be improved upon so this doesn t happen again  wildfires terrify   baffle me 
13444,i m not a huge fan of his overly boisterous on air persona  but he does a lot of good for his community   notably anytime there s a wildfire here in northern california   and beyond that  the dude knows amazing food and where to find it 
13445,i m on day  of the wildfire evacuee diet  cookies  pizza  chinese food  potato chips  halloween candy  cold cut sandwiches  the fire might be less hazardous for me 
13446,i m sick and tired of the directed energy weapons  dew  that continue to be used in these california wildfires  trees are not destroyed  but tires  glass  car metal melts            
13447,i m sorry to hear that  ve been breathing a lot of wildfire smoke lately  and air quality warnings were issued there last week  please be very careful when  ride outside  glenn  it may be better for  not to ride outside when there s so much smoke 
13448,i m starting to think this doesn t have a thing to do with  wildfires   honestly  what gives   when do  plan to turn the power back on  are  going to pay for the food in my fridges if it spoils  this plan sucks    
13449,i m tired and my eyes are burning from the wildfire smoke and there s a bomb squad on the other side of the block  where i can t see what s happening   and a car  honked and i screamed out loud  i think it s time to go to bed  no  i  t care that it s only pm 
13450,i m trying to think of what the equivalent of throwing paper towels to hurricane victims is for wildfire victims  watch this dude walk into a shelter with a big ass hose and  start spraying the heck out of these poor displaced families          
13451,i m walking back to my car after picking up my lunch and a few hundred feet in the distance i see a dude smoking a cigarette whom i can only barely make out because of how much wildfire smoke there is  mind blown  
13452,i ve  posted a  blog  california wildfires  verizon throttled data during crisis   august    at  pm verizon admits it should not have cut data speeds to a command and control vehicle  from bbc news   technology  
13453,i ve  posted a  blog  fox news  vehicle blamed for deadly california wildfire  
13454,i ve only done a blood donation so far for the wildfires here in northern ca   we usually do volunteer work for the local food bank and habitat for humanity   hopefully we can one of them before the end of the year 
13455,i ve put out osts of stuff  why  t  show me what demonstrates the ghe of co is so powerful that there s a problem  extreme weather is down  wildfires are down  food   prosperity are up  etc  what exactly scares   i agreed co has a ghe  i won t ever share  fears   twitter  qosvvoyl
13456,i       ll still take hurricanes over their wildfires  impossible to do a complete evac  too many cars  not enough roadway         
13457,i       m hoping someone has found him and he       s sitting safely in a shelter waiting for   
13458,i       m lying in bed at  in the morning completely terrified at our future  i can       t put into words how scared i am that my kids and their kids will live in a world ravaged by droughts  wildfires  and food shortages because some people               t believe in climate change         horrifying          
13459,i       m sorry but all these celebrities asking their fans to donate money to help with the wildfires is  mcdonalds asking its customers to donate food to the hungry 
13460,i       m supporting  for    of americans are food insecure and numbers have grown in ca since the devastating wildfires  all donations made by midnight tonight will be matched by facebook

13463,i       ve been close to a wildfire not this large scale but at least this intense  it can be compared to crawling inside a high wattage microwave while trying to flee inside  cars  it felt  hell on earth 
13464,i       ve been on the highway riding past wildfires before  feels         re in an oven  the heat it gives off is crazy  the ac on high in the car doesn       t help and u can hardly breathe  i can only imagine what people going thru tryna get out of there
13465,i       ve driven past  cant even compare wildfires  and literally from  lanes over i could feel the heat in my car 
13466,i       ve driven through a wildfire  this and the smell in the car   even with the air on recirculate   is horrendous    can feel the heat too   it       s terrible

13474,icymi  that annoying loitering haze over the rogue valley has been from stuff  car exhaust and controlled burns  not wildfire smoke             
13475,icymi  major climate report describes a strong risk of crisis as early as   the report  describes a world of worsening food shortages and wildfires and a mass die off of coral reefs as soon as      
13476,idea  every home should have an underground shelter on the property  able to withstand wildfires  tornadoes  bombs  etc   
13477,if  would give cali more money  we could fix our problems   we  t have enough cash for healthcare  welfare  cell phones  housing  food   education   so ask yourself do we waste cash on preventing wildfires or help our neighbors coming from the south  what s a few trees   twitter  svgcvtajad

13481,if california can       t even take care of their homeless with shelter  then why do they think migrants should be here   what are  doing with the homeless victims of the wildfires  take care of  own people first       
13482,if current trends continue  coral reefs would die  wildfires and heat waves would sweep across the planet between drought and flooding and temperature would mean that the world       s food supply would become dramatically less secure  civilization is at stake         
13483,if folks really wanted to end the wildfires out west then they would  give me the gas money to drive out there and wash my car   itll rain  i promise    if i see someone throw a cigarette they  finished smoking on the ground i m gonna pick that shit up and throw it in their face or in their car    wildfires start so easily that way      if i were ever driving while there was a wildfire and heard cats meowing or dogs barking near me
13484,if i       m gonna help god  i       m gonna start w  puerto rico  then flint  then put out wildfires  stop hurricanes  plug volcanoes  feed the hungry  shelter the homeless  cure disease  and stop wars  only thing i want to help trump with is lock pink handcuffs on his tiny little wrists 
13485,if neighbor science can help with the california wildfires  please let us   i changed the air filter in my house   months ago  so maybe my house will be useful as a base of operations  it s in va and we  t have any extra spots but  can double park behind my car

13488,if only we could pack fresh og salads in nor cal wildfire donation box  but gotta make it light   not perishable      found ur site advice on dehydrated snacks foods very helpful 
13489,if the water table in california is rising because of the rise in the ocean water next to it  then all of their thirsty food crops and other greenery will receive more beneficial water   this water should reduce the wildfire damage  small plants will start growing in the sahara 
13490,if there is insufficient shelter space for displaced fire victims it s because no one anticipated this unprecedented wildfire  it has zero to do with immigrants  i hope for help and healing for everyone suffering in these fires  and for those seeking refuge from dire situations
13491,if there was a way that the wildfires only burned down expensive houses and cars with their owners inside i would support them
13492,if there       s ever a time that i       m forcibly reminded that the rich stay healthy and the sick stay poor  it       s when the air quality gets dangerous from wildfires  i have the privilege to buy multiple air purifiers  spend a day in an air conditioned casino  own an air conditioned car   twitter  cwhtcf

13498,if trump wanted to attack the naming protocol of the ca wildfires  that s something i could get behind   has people around the country ready to blame some out of control s mores fest   earlier this year lots heard as car fire  could we switch to hurricane names 
13499,if trump withholds any funding from california for wildfires or for any need  whatsoever  then california should make our federal tax contributions contingent upon federal assistance when we need it  no help  then no california tax dollars or food grown in california to the fed 
13500,if we        t act now  there won       t be a planet left to save   must approve the omnibus environmental bill as soon as possible  a world of worsening food shortages  wildfires  and die offs of coral reefs will be here soon  there isn       t much time

13502,if we       re talking corn ethanol    the corn lobby is mighty  the energy retuned is very poor  palm oil demand is driven by food  photos   which takes us back to indonesia  orangutan extinction  clear cutting  and now  with the loss of forest rain  wildfire    brazil  
13503,if wildfire  truman  and diana aren       t on iridescense  imma be a little mad  because  refused to listen to any of the singles until byool came out  so i       ve been waiting     months to bump those in the car
13504,if wildfires are going to become more and more prevalent  small  isolated mountain communities must develop a shelter plan for residents  it is simply too chaotic to evacuate places that  being isolated and reclusive  there has to be a better way  
13505,if wildfires are going to become more prevalent  small  isolated mountain communities must develop a shelter plan for residents  it is simply too chaotic to evacuate places that  being isolated   reclusive  there has to be a better way

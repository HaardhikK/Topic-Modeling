## Exploring Deep Learning Techniques for Topic Modeling of Natural Disaster Tweets

Explores the utilization of machine learning techniques to analyze tweets related to natural disasters.
With a significant increase in the frequency and severity of natural disasters, understanding social media discourse during
such events is crucial for disaster management and response.
We applied various preprocessing techniques such as word vectorization, data cleaning, stop-word removal, and manual
removal of specific words to prepare the dataset. 
Subsequently,we employed two topic modeling algorithms, Latent Semantic
Analysis (LSA) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA),BERT Transformer and Llama-with BERT model to identify
underlying topics in the tweet dataset. Through our analysis, we aim to provide insights into the topics discussed during natural
disasters and compare the performance of the 4 models.

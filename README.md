## Exploring Deep Learning Techniques for Topic Modeling of Natural Disaster Tweets

The sheer quantity and depth of social media data have opened a gateway to
understand more about human behavior during certain conditions. The advent
of topic modeling models has significantly helped uncover underlying hidden patterns and offered new perspectives on interpreting social phenomena. However,
social media content is often brief, text-based and unstructured in nature, presenting difficulties for data collection and analysis. In this paper, we assess four
topic modeling techniques: Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), Latent Dirichlet
Allocation (LDA), BERT Transformer, and Llama3 with BERTopic. Using Twitter posts and tweets made during hurricanes, wildfires, blizzards, and flooding,
we implemented a comprehensive preprocessing pipeline that included stop-word
removal, word vectorization, data cleaning, and the manual exclusion of unnecessary phrases.This research evaluates the benefits of each technique, highlighting
each algorithmâ€™s strengths and weaknesses, particularly in the context of social
science applications. Furthermore, it sheds light on the efficacy of using traditional topic modeling models and generative models in conjunction with topic
modelling to analyse Twitter data.

# Exploring Deep Learning Techniques for Topic Modeling of Natural Disaster Tweets

The sheer quantity and depth of social media data have opened a gateway to understanding more about human behavior during certain conditions. The advent of topic modeling techniques has significantly helped uncover underlying hidden patterns and offered new perspectives on interpreting social phenomena. However, social media content is often brief, text-based, and unstructured in nature, presenting difficulties for data collection and analysis.

In this paper, we assess four topic modeling techniques: Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), BERT Transformer, and Llama3 with BERTopic. Using Twitter posts and tweets made during hurricanes, wildfires, blizzards, and flooding, we implemented a comprehensive preprocessing pipeline that included stop-word removal, word vectorization, data cleaning, and the manual exclusion of unnecessary phrases.

This research evaluates the benefits of each technique, highlighting each algorithmâ€™s strengths and weaknesses, particularly in the context of social science applications. Furthermore, it sheds light on the efficacy of using traditional topic modeling models and generative models in conjunction with topic modeling to analyze Twitter data.
